# 3d-engine-python
A (very slow) 3D engine in Python.

This is a python implementation of [this](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/OneLoneCoder_olcEngine3D_Part3.cpp).
Depends on Pygame. Controls are E, S, D, F and arrow keys.

Unfortunately I couldn't get texturing to work, but considering the performance I doubt it would've worked well anyway.
